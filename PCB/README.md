# PCB
This directory contains the PCB files that I have created in KiCad so far, sorted as SBC PCBs and Modular System PCBs, along with any supporting documentation. The Modular System subdirectory contains a template for creating your own modules. See the READMEs in each subdirectory to get specific instructions for each board.

## Modular System Requirements
The three required boards for a working ZTO-80 Modular System are the Backplane, CPU board, and Memory board. Either the SIO or PIO board is required for output. The rest of the boards are optional and simply add additional features.
