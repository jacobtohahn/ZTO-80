# ZTO-80 SBC
This folder contains all the KiCad files for the ZTO-80 SBC, along with an additional files and documentation.

Please note that this board has never been manufactured and is simply a prototype. If you would like to make one yourself, be sure to completely examine the schematic for errors. I will make one myself soon to check for errors.

## Additional files and subdirectories
- **PDF**: A subdirectory containing PDF files of the schematic and PCB.
- **Getting Started with the ZTO-80 SBC.pdf**: A getting started guide for the SBC.
