# ZTO-80 SBC
This folder contains all the Kicad files for the ZTO-80 SBC, along with an additional files and documentation.

Please note that this board has never been manufactured and is simply a prototype. If you would like to make one yourself, be sure to completely examine the schematic for errors. I will make one myself soon to check for errors.

## Additional files and subdirectories
- **SBC_BOM.csv**: A CSV file containing the Bill of Materials for all the parts required to build the SBC.
- **PDF**: A subdirectory containing PDF files of the schematic and PCB.
