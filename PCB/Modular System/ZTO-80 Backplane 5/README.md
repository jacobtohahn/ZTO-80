# ZTO-80 Backplane 5
This is the main backplane for the ZTO-80 Modular System. It includes 5 module slots, a power input jack and LED, a reset button, two headers for connecting an external power LED and reset switch, and six M3 mounting holes.

The power input supports 5V only. Anything over 5.5 volts could damage or destroy some ICs.

## Component Notes
The ZTO-80 bus header slots should be female sockets.

I recommend using pan-head M3 machine screws with a washer to fasten the board with the mounting holes.
