## Modular System PCBs
The subfolders in this directory contain the KiCad project files and additional files for Modular System boards. Look in each subfolder for information on each board and files.

## Component Notes
Unless stated otherwise in a README or silkscreen, always use CMOS ICs to build your system.

To bridge jumpers, I recommend using standard 0.1 in. jumper shunts.

Please note that the 40-pin bus header uses a non-standard PCB footprint in my designs. This is to keep compatability with my older designs, which used the same footprint. The footprint still works with standard headers and isn't an issue unless you are making your own designs. To use this footprint, see the PCB design in the "ZTO-80 Template" subfolder.
