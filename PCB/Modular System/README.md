## Modular System PCBs
The subfolders in this directory contain the KiCad project files for Modular System boards. Look in each subfolder for information on each board.

## Component Notes
Unless stated otherwise in a README or silkscreen, always use CMOS ICs to build your system.

To bridge jumpers, I recommend using standard jumper shunts.
