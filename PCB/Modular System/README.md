## Modular System PCBs
The subfolders in this directory contain the KiCad project files and additional files for Modular System boards. Look in each subfolder for information on each board and files.

## Component Notes
Unless stated otherwise in a README or silkscreen, always use CMOS ICs to build your system.

To bridge jumpers, I recommend using standard 0.1 in. jumper shunts.
