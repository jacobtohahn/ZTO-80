# Datasheets
The subdirectories of this folder contain PDF datasheets for any ICs used.

Keep in mind that some pins may have slightly different names than what I used in my schematics, but it should be easy to tell which corresponds with which.

All datasheets included are not written by me and are copyrighted by their respective authors.
