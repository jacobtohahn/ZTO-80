# Code
The subdirectories in this folder contain assembly code, hex files, and supporting files to allow compiling. For information on specific files, check out the READMEs in each subdirectory.

If you just want to get started with the ZTO-80 SBC, check out the releases tab for the latest compiled ROM.

The modified NASCOM BASIC is copyright Grant Searle and has been modified further by me to work with the Z80 SIO/0.
